Just another ripository


Hi All!

My name is Lukas Bertino and I am currently in Theatrical Movie Liscening but have recently started learning to code in HTML, CSS and Javascript. My plan is to learn to code and land a job in the fast paced tech world within the next 3 months. I know this is lofty goal but I have what it takes to make it happen.
